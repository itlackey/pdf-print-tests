      <p class="drop-cap">T</p><p class="first-paragraph">he ancient tome lay open upon the weathered oak table, its yellowed pages crackling with each turn. Strange symbols danced across the parchment, seeming to shift and writhe in the flickering candlelight that cast long shadows across the chamber walls.</p>
      
      <p>For generations, the scholars of Valdris had sought to decipher the cryptic writings contained within these pages. Many had gone mad in the attempt, their minds shattered by revelations too terrible for mortal comprehension. Yet still they came, drawn by the promise of forbidden knowledge.</p>
      
      <p>The keeper of the archive—an elderly woman known only as the Chronicler—watched from the doorway as the young adventurer traced the symbols with trembling fingers. She had seen this scene play out countless times before, and she knew well how it would end.</p>
      
      <p>"You seek answers that were never meant to be found," she said, her voice dry as the dust that coated the shelves around them. "The Forgotten Realm guards its secrets jealously."</p>
      
      <p>But the adventurer did not turn. Could not turn. The symbols had already begun their work, burrowing into consciousness like parasites of pure information, rewriting thought itself into patterns that served only darkness.</p>

      <h3>Darkness & Light</h3>
      <p>In the Forgotten Realm, darkness is more than mere absence of light—it is a living force that hungers for the warmth of mortal souls. These variant rules emphasize the importance of light sources and the dangers of traveling through shadow-touched lands.</p>
      
      <div class="callout-box">
        <div class="callout-header">Designer's Note</div>
        <p>These rules increase the difficulty significantly. We recommend using them only for experienced groups who want a more challenging, horror-focused experience.</p>
      </div>
      
      <h4>Torch Duration</h4>
      <p>In areas touched by shadow magic, torches burn for only half their normal duration. Magical light sources function normally unless specified otherwise in the area description.</p>
      
      <h4>Extended Darkness</h4>
      <p>Characters who spend more than 1 hour in complete darkness without a light source must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or gain one level of <em>Dread</em> (see Dread Conditions, below).</p>

      <p>Dread can be removed by completing a long rest in an area of bright light, or by the <em>greater restoration</em> spell.</p>
